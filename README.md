# female-candidates-PRN2023
An interactive dashboard on female participations in Malaysia State Elections (PRN) 2023 as candidates.


I have always intrigued with the representation of women in the political settings in my home country, Malaysia. From my experience, the participation of women are still lacking. However, there is no data to confirm nor back this view up, until I came across [Thevesh's tweet](https://twitter.com/Thevesh/status/1685465423926681600) about an open data that he had gathered together from Suruhanjaya Pilihan Raya (SPR) ie Election Commission of Malaysia. In the data, he added sex, age, and ethnicity of all the candidates. 


I downloaded the data and play around it to look for possible insights that I can shed some lights on. I noticed there is a lack of 'coalition' information on the data, which is a very crucial information for the political settings in the moment. I added a conditional column in PowerQuery to group together different political parties that had formed coalitions. 


| Coalition | Parties |
| --------- | --------- |
| PH-BN | PKR, DAP, Amanah, BN |
| PN | PAS, Bersatu |
| MUDA-PSM | MUDA, PSM |


After that I began designing the dashboard on Power BI. For the dashboard, I am focusing on the female representation in the election. Only several informations, such as number of female candidates, the percentage, total candidates, and a bar graph to breakdown the numbers according to the six states. I also included a filter to enable users to choose between the different political coalitions.

This is a simple, insightful, yet fun small project to do. I wish to expand this project into a bigger scope with more data. Probably using data from past elections. More to come!
